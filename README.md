## Leveraging the Power of NumPy and CLIP Embeddings in Pandas DataFrame

### Introduction

This repository demonstrates the efficient use of NumPy and CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) embeddings within a Pandas DataFrame for similarity search tasks. The integration of these technologies provides a robust alternative to traditional vector databases, offering accelerated performance and ease of implementation.

### Highlights

- **NumPy's `vstack` Method**: NumPy's `vstack` method is leveraged to efficiently convert the 'image_embeddings' column of a Pandas DataFrame into a single NumPy array. This consolidation enables seamless computation of cosine similarity scores between the prompt embedding and all embeddings in the DataFrame.

- **CLIP Embeddings**: CLIP, a deep learning model by OpenAI, is utilized to generate text embeddings. These embeddings capture semantic information, facilitating accurate similarity search across multimodal datasets.

### Implementation Details

The repository contains Python code that demonstrates the following functionalities:

1. Loading CLIP Model: The CLIP model is loaded using PyTorch and configured for evaluation mode.

2. Text Embedding Generation: Text embeddings are generated for given labels using the CLIP model. The process is optimized for batch processing, ensuring efficiency.

3. Image Embedding Retrieval: Image embeddings from a preprocessed dataset are extracted and consolidated into a NumPy array using NumPy's `vstack` method.

4. Similarity Search: Cosine similarity scores are calculated between the prompt embedding and all embeddings in the DataFrame. The DataFrame is sorted based on these similarity scores, providing relevant search results.

### Conclusion

By harnessing the capabilities of NumPy and CLIP embeddings within a Pandas DataFrame, this repository offers a powerful solution for similarity search tasks. The streamlined workflow and optimized computations underscore the versatility and efficiency of these technologies in real-world applications.
